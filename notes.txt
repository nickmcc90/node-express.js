Express, Node, and terminal notes


Mkdir - means make a folder

Cd .. means to go back a folder

We can run javascript files using Node.js like we would
Run .py files using python

// example.js
console.log(“hello”)

>> Node example.js

Just like:

// hello.py
console.log(“hello”)

>> python hello.py


Some things require different versions of node. Installing nvm “node version manager”
Would be a good idea to do this.


Npm is a place that storage a whole lot of people’s code that can help you to build anything. Expess
Is one of these packages that can be installed with

Npm install express —save

This makes sense now. React, vite, and anything you do to create a project in node has the npm install in front of it.
People can make bundles of code that do specific things, and people can publish them and they can become
Popular. Express and vite became popular. These packages can improve upon optimizations or specific tasks.


1. If you type npm init -y (the -y is to skip the questions about configurations), a package.json
Appears. 
This .json file allows us to store all the different node packages that we want to integrate into our
Projects. 

**I’m now getting this, there are packages in npm that already have this package.json filled out with scripts
And dependencies. This is the first time that I’m bare-bones making a server by going into the packages.

2. We are going to be making a server. Server.js. 
Change “main”: “server.js”
And put a
“Dev”: “node server.js”
Inside of the scripts key.

3. Now we can make a file called server.js.
